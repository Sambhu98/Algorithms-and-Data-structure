nCr= (n-1)C(r-1) + (n-1)Cr

stars and bar formula
Theorem 2
- the number of ways of choosing k tuples of non-negative integers such that their sum is n
is (n+k-1)C(k-1) or (n+k-1)Cn 

Example
n=3 k=2;
tuples are (3,0) ,(1,2) ,(2,1),(0,3)
point - here choosen number can be zero as the formula is for non-negative integers
for positive integers follow Theorem 1
